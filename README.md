## About Me

Full-stack engineer specializing in **scalable backend systems** and **AI applications**. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Arizona State University (GPA: 3.78/4.0), graduating May 2026.

I thrive in building production-grade systems that solve real problems-from intelligent chatbots that eliminate manual analyst work to distributed face recognition systems handling 100+ concurrent requests. My experience spans delivering microservices for video streaming platforms, architecting RAG pipelines, and optimizing cloud infrastructure.
